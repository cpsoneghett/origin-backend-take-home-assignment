# Origin Challenge API

Origin offers its users an insurance package personalized to their specific needs without requiring the user to understand anything about insurance. This allows Origin to act as their *de facto* insurance advisor.

Origin determines the user’s insurance needs by asking personal & risk-related questions and gathering information about the user’s vehicle and house. Using this data, Origin determines their risk profile for **each** line of insurance and then suggests an insurance plan (`"economic"`, `"regular"`, `"responsible"`) corresponding to her risk profile.

Thus, this project implements an API endpoint that receives a JSON payload with the user information and returns her risk profile (also as JSON response).
